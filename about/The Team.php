  We are the St. Ignatius High School Robotics Team (Falcotronix)
 consisting of many enthusiastic students led by several dedicated
 teachers at our school. The goal of Falcotronix is to promote
 STEM and FIRST Robotics not only in our school community, but in
 the city of Thunder Bay. Our team helps students develop
 essential skills for the future in both academics and leadership.
 Our devoted and experienced mentors teach students new skills
 in leadership, marketing, engineering, communication, and critical
 thinking. As a newly formed team, we strive to continue to succeed
 FIRST Robotics events and in time form a well established Robotics program
 in our school.
