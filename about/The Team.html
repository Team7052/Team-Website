    In the 2017 First Robotics Season, the Falcotronix Robotics Team
    learned much from competing in two First Robotics Competition (FRC) events. As a
    disadvantaged rookie team, the Falcotronix was learning to design,
    build, and program a robot for the first time ever. Despite this, by the end
    of the season, we found ourselves with a very competitive robot.
    At our first competition in the beginning of March 2018, nine
    members of Falcotronix travelled to Oshawa to represent not only
    our school, but Thunder Bay as a whole.
    Despite experiencing various technical difficulties over the duration
    of the tournament, we are proud to have placed 16th out of a total 38
    teams from all Ontario. Inspired  by our success at the large event,
    our team looked ambitiously looked towards our next FRC event in North Bay
    later that same month and attempted to rework the shortcomings of the
    robot. Unfortunately, with limited experience and time, we were unable
    to find a definite fix for the robot and placed 29th out of the 32 teams at
    the North Bay event. After learning much from our first year, we look forward
    to a successful second year. For the 2018/2019 FRC
    season, we are excited to learn from our mistakes and helpful advice from
    veteran teams and hope to not only attend another two FRC events, but
    qualify of the Ontario Provincial event.

    We are the St. Ignatius High School Robotics Team (Falcotronix)
   consisting of many enthusiastic students led by several dedicated
   teachers at our school. The goal of Falcotronix is to promote
   STEM education and FIRST Robotics not only in our school community, but in
   the city of Thunder Bay. Our team helps students develop
   essential skills for the future in leadership and many academic fields.
   Our devoted and experienced mentors teach students new skills
   in leadership, marketing, engineering, communication, and critical
   thinking. As a newly formed team, we strive to continue to succeed
   in official FIRST Robotics Competition events and, in time, form
   a well established Robotics program at our school.
