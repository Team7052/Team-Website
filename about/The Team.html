  <h1>About Our Team</h1>
  <p>
    We are the St. Ignatius High School Robotics Team (Falcotronix)
  consisting of many enthusiastic students led by several dedicated
  teachers at our school. The goal of Falcotronix is to promote
  STEM education and FIRST Robotics not only in our school community, but in
  the city of Thunder Bay.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our team helps students develop
    essential skills for the future in leadership and many academic fields.
    Our devoted and experienced mentors teach students new skills
    in leadership, marketing, engineering, communication, and critical
    thinking.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a newly formed team, we strive to continue to succeed
    in official FIRST Robotics Competition events and, in time, form
    a well established Robotics program at our school.
  </p>
  <p>
      In the 2017 First Robotics Season, the Falcotronix Robotics Team
      learned much from competing in two First Robotics Competition (FRC) events. As a
      disadvantaged rookie team, the Falcotronix was learning to design,
      build, and program a robot for the first time ever. Despite this, by the end
      of the season, we found ourselves with a very competitive robot.
  </p>
  <p>
      At our first competition in the beginning of March 2018, nine
      members of Falcotronix travelled to Oshawa to represent not only
      our school, but Thunder Bay as a whole.
      Despite experiencing various technical difficulties over the duration
      of the tournament, we are proud to have placed 16th out of a total 38
      teams from all Ontario.
  </p>
  <p>
      Inspired  by our success at the large event,
      our team looked ambitiously towards our next FRC event in North Bay
      later that same month and attempted to rework the shortcomings of the
      robot. Unfortunately, with limited experience and time, we were unable
      to find a definite fix for the robot and placed 29th out of the 32 teams at
      the North Bay event.
  </p>
  <p>
      After learning much from our first year, we look forward
      to a successful second year. For the 2018/2019 FRC
      season, we are excited to learn from our mistakes and helpful advice from
      veteran teams and hope to not only attend another two FRC events, but
      qualify of the Ontario Provincial event.
